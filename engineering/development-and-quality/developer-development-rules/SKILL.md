description: "Trigger: developer-development-rules, engineering craft, clean code, modular architecture, small diffs, pre-factoring, definition of done gate. Scope: Core Software Engineering Craft & Execution. Enforces modularity, pre-factoring, small reversible diffs (<200 LOC), and engineering DoD gates. Boundary: Excludes cloud infrastructure architecture."

# 🏗️ Core Philosophy: Build small, clear, composable pieces.

## When to use

Use this skill when the task is primarily about engineering and this guidance is the most relevant operating rule set.

## When not to use

Do not use this skill as the primary guide when another skill has a tighter domain fit for the requested output.

## Trigger cues

- Request explicitly references `developer-development-rules` or this source file.
- Request language includes terms like: developer, development, rules.
- Keywords include: implementation, TDD, tests, architecture, performance, web security, code review.

## Routing boundary

- Primary for code quality, test strategy, security hardening, and performance engineering.
- Do not use as primary for product positioning or conversion copy strategy.

## Inputs required

- Goal or task request
- Current constraints (time, scope, platform, risk)
- Existing artifacts (code, docs, screenshots, metrics) when available
- Source of truth: `subagents/rules/developer/developer-development-rules.md`

## Instructions

1. Read [references/source.md](references/source.md) first.
2. Extract the non-negotiable rules and translate them into a short execution checklist.
3. Apply the checklist to the current task, produce concrete outputs, and avoid abstract recommendations.
4. Validate outcomes with evidence (tests, screenshots, logs, diffs, or written audit findings).
5. Record decisions and tradeoffs so another engineer can continue without re-discovery.

## Output format

- Primary decision/output: Implementation approach, test coverage, and risk controls.
- Summary: one-paragraph decision or result
- Actions: compact checklist with owners and status
- Evidence: links/paths to artifacts proving completion
## Definition of Done (DoD) Verification Gate for Code Increments

No pull request, task branch, or delegated implementation increment may be declared COMPLETE without satisfying the universal engineering Definition of Done (DoD):

- [ ] **1. Test-Driven Verification (TDD)**: 100% automated test pass rate. Unit and integration tests cover all BDD acceptance scenarios and edge cases.
- [ ] **2. Small-Batch Cleanliness**: Diff is bounded ($\le 200$ lines of changed code). Zero dead code, debug logging, or commented-out blocks.
- [ ] **3. Strict Type & Lint Compliance**: Zero TypeScript/Linter errors, zero compiler warnings, zero broken imports.
- [ ] **4. Security & Unhappy Path Hardening**: Inputs validated at boundaries, zero plaintext credentials or secrets, structured error handling with fallbacks.
- [ ] **5. Deterministic Evidence Artifact**: Verifiable proof provided in completion report (CLI test execution logs, passing test fixtures, or DOM/screenshot diffs).
